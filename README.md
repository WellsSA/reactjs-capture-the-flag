# Frontend Capture the Flag Project

Welcome to the Frontend Capture the Flag Project!

Recently it has come to my attention that Frontend Capture the flag exists, and I thought it would be
a really good way to help students understand how important the basis are.

This project is based on a real capture the flag challenge seen in a job application, so hopefully practicing on this challenge
can really help you in a future opportunity :)
